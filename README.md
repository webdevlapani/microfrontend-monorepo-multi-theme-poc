Monorepo starter using Vite and Turborepo to create microfrontend React apps, libraries, docs, testing, tooling, and more.

# Requirements

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

We recommend an LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16.

# Local Development

To work on MyOrg web apps, from the root,

1. Run `pnpm install`

2. Run `pnpm dev`

# Environment

Please see `apps/core/.env` for a list of environment variables you can set.

# Testing

To run tests for all packages with Vitest, from the root, run `pnpm test`.

To run end-to-end tests for all apps with Cypress, from the root, run `pnpm e2e`.

When writing tests, we have helpers available in both environments using [@testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about).

# Production

To deploy the `@myorg/core` app, from the root,

1. Run `pnpm build`

2. Run `pnpm --filter "@myorg/core" run preview` to preview the app.

In production, please see [`myorg/server`](https://github.myorg.com/myorg/myorg-server).

# Guide

## How do I create a new app or package?

To create a new app, run `pnpm new-app` or `pnpm new-app-ts` (TypeScript).

To add a library, run `pnpm new-library` or `pnpm new-library-ts` (TypeScript).

## How should I create a branch for my new code?

The `main` branch is the production code.

Each package has a branch called `next-<package>`, e.g. `next-shared`. This is an eternal branch with the new code for `<package>`.

To create an update, branch `feature/*` from `next-<package>` and merge back into `next-<package>` to commit your work.

UAT branches are available, and should be named `uat-<package>` to provide a deployment in the staging environment.

## How do I preview my new code?

Every time a commit is pushed up, it will have a new review app deployed.

If it is a `uat-<package>` branch, it will be available at `https://review.myorg.com/uat-<package>`.

All other commits will be available to preview at `https://review.myorg.com/<commit-short-sha>`, where `<commit-short-sha>` is the first 8 characters of the commit hash.

## How do I add a dependency to my project?

To add a dependency to a specific workspace, run `pnpm --filter "workspace" add <package-to-add>`, e.g. `pnpm --filter "@myorg/data" add d3`.

> **Note: Do not add dependencies to the root workspace.**

## What libraries should I know about?

Please see our [Storybook](https://storybook.myorg.com) to see the docs and learn about what packages you can use. You can run Storybook locally while you work on your projects with `pnpm run docs`.

`@myorg/core`: Our main MyOrg web app

`@myorg/shell`: Our core UI and design library that extends and configures Material UI

`@myorg/shared`: Shared code between all MyOrg packages

`@myorg/<app>-ui`: Packages with this name format are UI libraries built for specific apps but can still be used by other apps, e.g. `@myorg/dashboard-ui` was built for the Dashboard portal but may provide useful UI for your project

## How do I version, tag, release, or publish a new version of a package?

We handle this with the `changesets` CLI tool.

A developer creates a changeset, which is just a changelog for the package being updated. Then they'll version it, and if required, release it to a registry.

1. Ensure you are on a `next-<package>` branch. Merge `main` in
2. Run `pnpm changeset-create` to write your changelog (use spacebar to pick packages)
3. Run `pnpm changeset-save-prerelease <tag-suffix>` **only** if you want to create a specific prerelease version. For example, `pnpm changeset-save-prerelease rc` creates `@myorg/package@1.7.3-rc.0`
4. To create the new version, run `pnpm changeset-save`
5. To publish the new version to the registry, run `pnpm changeset-tag-and-publish`
6. To instead **only tag** the new versions, but not publish, run `pnpm changeset-tag`
7. Run `git push --follow-tags`

## How do I fix CORS errors in development for a URL I am using in my project?

If you are facing CORS errors in development, you may want to update your API's CORS rules in that environment. If that is not an option and your package is built with Vite (e.g. `@myorg/core`), please update the development server proxy rules:

In `apps/core/vite.config.ts`, configure your local API URL and the target API URL in the `server.proxy` object.
